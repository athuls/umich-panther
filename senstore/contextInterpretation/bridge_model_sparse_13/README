This directory currently has data for sparse nodes i.e. only on the surface with 13 elements identified

Have the ground truth with surface nodes only first, before running this experiment!!!
NOTE : view angle will be 30 degrees only for the ground truth. It will change only for the error positions, i.e. it will become 45 and 60 degrees
